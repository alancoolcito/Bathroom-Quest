About the game -
"Bathroom Quest" was inspired by life events, waking up in the middle of the night and not
being sure if I'm asleep or awake. Just knowing that I need to get to the toilet.
Charly (The game's hero) goes through a journey from his room => the hallway => the stairs =>
the living room => the kitchen => the living room again => the stairs again => the hallway again and
finally reaches the glorious bathroom.
If there were more levels to the game, it would content bigger houses, more difficult 
challenges and split roads. Sometimes he would be drunk and woozy, into a nightmare with monsters
or confused and move backwards. The payoff would be new characters and new patterns for
the house. 
The psychedelic theme was chosen in order to illustrate Charly's point of view, having the world
mixed up between a dream and reality.

About the creator -
My name is Alan Perel.
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1992) and got to Jerusalem, Israel by the year 2000. 
From the age of five I started to play "Monkey Island" with my dad and from 1999 till today
I persistently play "Heroes of Might & Magic 3". Video games were always a huge part of my life,
granting me escapism in hard times, harmony in the good times (with some rage quit exceptions)
and an eternal source of creativity and imagination.
I spent four years at "Sapir Academy" learning scriptwriting and then moved to Tel Aviv and got
to "Shenkar Academy" in order to learn video game design.
People call me "The spontaneous and sensitive Argentine" and my greatest achievement was the 
screening of a Pilot I wrote at the "Comic-Con" of San Diego, California.
